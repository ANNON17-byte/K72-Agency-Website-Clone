    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;K72 is an agency that builds brands from every angle. Today, tomorrow and
      years from now. We think the best sparks fly when comfort zones get left
      behind and friction infuses our strategies, brands and communications with
      real feeling. We’re transparent, honest and say what we mean, and when we
      believe in something, we’re all in.
